This Haskell code uses an unsafe function that can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes:

```haskell
import Data.Array.Unboxed

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let arr = listArray (1,10) [1..10] :: UArray Int Int
  print $ arr ! 11 -- accessing element outside bounds
```

The `(!)` operator in `Data.Array.Unboxed` doesn't perform bounds checking. Accessing an element outside the array's bounds results in undefined behavior.
